# Sitemap.xml

This app creates the sitemap.xml file for your site. It includes the main tags of sitemap (`<loc>`, `<lastmod>` and `<changefreq>`). `<priority>` tag has the default value of 0.5. The app's features are very basic, so forking (or sending pull requests with improvements) are encouraged.

The app has a setting to add content types and their change frequency to sitemap.xml file. It also adds a controller mapping to the path of sitemap.xml on the root of the site - `[yoursite.something]/sitemap.xml`

Check out [Sitemaps XML format](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) to learn more about how it works.
